"The static cache will attempt to serve previously rendered version of the "
"requested web pages to visitors who aren't logged in. The key drawback is "
"that your visitors are not always viewing the latest version of your web "
"pages. Lists of recent posts and recent comments, for instance, may take up "
"to 12 hours to refresh across your site. In addition, it prevents any random "
"elements that are introduced at the php level from working."

msgid ""
"Key web pages on your site will get refreshed when you edit your posts and "
"pages, so as to ensure they're reasonably fresh. Newly approved comments "
"will trigger throttled refreshes of an even smaller subset of web pages. "
"Statically cached web pages expire after 12 hours."

#: sem-cache-admin.php:198
msgid ""
"The benefit of the filesystem-based static cache is that your site's key web "
"pages, such as the site's front page or individual posts, will be served "
"without even loading PHP. This allows for maximum scalability if your site "
"is getting hammered by excrutiating traffic."
msgstr ""

#: sem-cache-admin.php:201
msgid ""
"The memcached-based static cache works in a similar manner, but stores "
"cached pages in memcached rather than on the filesystem. PHP is always "
"loaded, so it's a bit slower for key web pages; but it's much faster than "
"using the filesystem for other web pages."

msgid ""
"You'll usually want both turned on, in order to get the best of both worlds. "
"The only exception is if your site is hosted on multiple servers: in this "
"case, consider sticking to the memory-based static cache, because of the lag "
"introduced by the filesystem's synchronisations from a server to the next."

#: sem-cache-admin.php:232
msgid ""
"The query cache primarily benefits commentors and users who are logged in; "
"in particular yourself. These users cannot benefit from a static cache, "
"because each of web page on your site potentially contains data that is "
"specific to them; but they fully benefit from a query cache."
msgstr ""

#: sem-cache-admin.php:235
msgid ""
"The query cache's refresh policy is similar to that of the memory-based "
"static cache: key queries are flushed whenever you edit posts or pages, or "
"approve new comments. All of the remaining queries expire after 12 hours."

"The object cache stores granular bits of information in memcached, and makes "
"them available from a page to the next. This allows WordPress to load web "
"pages without always needing to retrieve things such as options, users, or "
"individual entries from the database."
msgstr ""

#: sem-cache-admin.php:263

"The object cache's primary benefit is that it is always accurate: at no time "
