A high performance cache for WordPress.


== Description ==

The Semiologic Cache plugin for WordPress is a high performance cache for sites built using WP.

Activate the Semiologic Cache plugin, and browse Settings / Cache to use the plugin.

Contrary to similar WP plugins, this one strives for simplicity. There are no complicated looking options to choose from. The cache is either off, on or locked.

The locked cache differs in that it does not refresh posts when new comments are posted. You'll want to activate this option if a page on your site is the subject of massive incoming traffic from the social media sites such as Digg, Reddit or Slashdot.

The [Semiologic forum](http://forum.semiologic.com) is the best place to report issues.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


== Change Log ==
